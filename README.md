# Architecture 
 - The angular isa mostly used for single page applications whereas Express is a multi-page application. Express applicatons can use embedded JavaScript template to load data into the web pages . While Angular projects use view and routing are done by manipulating conmpoenentson a single page.
 - The reason why we used a NoSQL MongoDB database was because it was easy to modify the schema based on scaling and functionality.

# Functionality
 - JSON's data uses an interchange format whereas JavaScript is a scripting language. JSON is a way to format the object data, which can be ready by JavaScript. JSON and JavaScript attach both the frontend and backend together by making a way for data to be stored in the backend. 
 - To make improvements to the functionality, I did some refactorig at times and made sure to help better separate the compoenents. That way they can be rendered seprately instead of rendering the same type of information. 

# Testing
 - I tested endpoints by utilizing postman and and using the localhost web address for the API endpoints. After testing that the added security is correct, I used methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to make sure the requests were still working. 

# Reflection
 - This course has helped me keep up with my daily coding by having me add a new coding language to my repertoire. The resources that was provided from the professor as well as the clear instructions from the annoucements every week, made me have a sense of ongoing support despite not having the in person feel to it. With that being said I was able to absorb and acknowledge the shortcomings I had and with that I was able to understand the different languages presented to me because of this class.
